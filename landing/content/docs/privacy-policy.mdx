> **Important Note:** This Privacy Policy applies only to the hosted version of OpenShortPath (OpenShortPath Cloud). If you self-host the open-source version of OpenShortPath, this privacy policy does not apply to you.

At OpenShortPath Cloud, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our service.

- **URL Information:** We collect information about all the URLs you create, including the original destination URLs, shortened link identifiers, and any custom aliases you choose.
- **Payment Information:** When you subscribe to our paid service, we collect payment receipts and transaction information from Stripe, our payment provider. We do not store your full payment card details, as these are handled securely by Stripe.

### Information We Collect Automatically
